Kelpie was developed as part of our involvement in the eChallenge program run by the University of Adelaide. The program was set up to develop innovative ideas and entrepreneurial skills, something I was keen to explore and learn at the time.

Kelpie started as a an exploration of data and how it could be used in agriculture. Through course of the program and our research the problem we identified was not the collection of data, but the ability to turn it into actions on the farm. Kelpie was developed from the familiar farm concept of the "working dog" - a faithful companion and vital hand on the farm.

Kelpie took out a third place and a runners up in the final of the eChallenge competition.

We carried on our initial development to the prototype stage, showing how the interface could be used to connect APIs from different products and enhanced to create logic triggers to utilise different tools and services.

The Kelpie team participated in the Hybrid World Startup Bootcamp, winning through to the finals and pitching to a conference audience of around 300 people.

After the initial success of the idea, when we started to develop it further we uncovered an immature environment in regards to data standards, interoperability and openness. While there were a number of startups working on these problems (like [Pairtree]()), they were definitely some way off at that point in time.

Our assessment of the current state was that while our idea was solid our timing was off and we were too early. Our skillset was in UI/UX, and that was what Kelpie was â€“ a better UI for farmers - and it was impossible to build that until the data aspects were sorted. The idea of developing a digital assistant outside the consumer realm has a lot of appeal, but it requires a more stable environment.

While I'm not active in the AgTech sector any more, I do keep abreast of whats happening and we are starting to see change across the sector. There are a number of open standards being developed and a range of technologies being rolled-out that would allow Kelpie to be developed further now than was previously possible.
